QB Analysys Project
Using Data sets provided from Todd Steussie on Kaggle, I have/am constructing a fun way to being QB Data to life. Currently the project is built to
outline qb completion proficiency based on pass depth/down and qb interception statistics based on pass depth,down or run game efficiency.

Prerequisites
Data Files can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present?select=plays.csv
Update path in script to wherever wanted.

Instructions
The script will prompt selection of what type of data set youd like to see, just answer!


Built With the following packages.
pandas
matplotlib

TO DO LIST:
Add run game efficiency with qb completion.
Add GUI for friendly UX.
Add more detailed comments.
Create a more organized file structure.
